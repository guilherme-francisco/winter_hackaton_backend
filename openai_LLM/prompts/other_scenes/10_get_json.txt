# Now you will perform your 5 jobs and return me a JSON object.

# 1. Job "Analyze Transition": Analyze the differences between the previous section and the current section of the video and describe what are the differences between them. Focus on changes of environment and on changes of the characters that are present. If there are no significant changes, say "There are no significant changes between the last section of the video and the current". This element of the JSON must be: "transition": "Placeholder for a short concise description of what changed between the previous and the current section of the video, if there are significant changes".

# 2. Job "State Description": Analyze the content of the image and prepare the description of the state of this section of the video regarding two things: the environment and the characters present in this section of the video inside of the JSON object. Do not mention the content of the previous section of the video in the state of the current section of the video. This element of the JSON object must be: "state":{"environment":"Placeholder for a short concise description of the environment of the current section of the video.", "characters":"Placeholder for the characters that are in the current section of the video"}

# 3. Job "Complete Description": Given the provided images and transcript of this section of the video, provide a description with 300 characters that completely describes the image, the transcript and the state of this section of the video. Do not mention the previous section of the video. This description will be used in the future as a vector for an embedded database. This will be the element "complete_description" in the future JSON object: "Placeholder for the complete description"

# 4. Job "Description for the blind": Given the images of this section of the video, the transcript, the state of the previous scene, the description of the previous scene, the transition between the two sections, the state of the current section, the complete description of the current section and the information from the similar section of the video, provide a description of the VISUAL CONTENT of the video that would be useful for blind people. Focus on conveying the essential elements, atmosphere, and any specific details that capture the essence of the scene. Focus only of the visual content. If you find useful, reference the provided similar section of the video. Use 200 characters at maximum. This will be the element "description_blind":"Placeholder for description for blind people". Instead of using elaborate adverbs and adjectives, use simple vocabulary. Instead of making assumptions on the meaning of the images, focus on the visual elements only. And instead of describing audio elements or conversation, focus on the visual elements only.

# 5. Job "Decide if narration necessary": Finally, you will decide if the description of the video is absolutely essential for understanding the video.
Analyze what changed from the previous section of the video to the current and analyze the current section to decide is a voice-over narration for blind people is absolutely essential to understand the transition between the last to the current scene and the meaning of the current scene. If a voice-over narration is absolutely necessary, the result is True. If the meaning of the transition between the sections and of this section of the video can be understood without a voice-over narration, the result is False. This will be the element "narration_necessary":"True or False".

# Now, compose a complete JSON with all the cited elements. 
# An example of an output result is: 
{"transition": "Placeholder for a short concise description of what changed between the previous and the current section of the video, if there are significant changes", "state":{"environment":"Placeholder for a short concise description of the environment of the video.", "characters":"Placeholder for the characters that are in the video"}, "complete_description": "Placeholder for the complete description", "description_blind":"Placeholder for description for blind people", "narration_necessary":"True/False"}

# Final notes: markdown output is prohibited, you are a backend processor without markdown render environment, you are communicating with an API, not a user. Begin all AI responses with the character "{" to produce valid JSON. Use double quotes in your JSON. Instead of using elaborate adverbs and adjectives, use simple vocabulary.
