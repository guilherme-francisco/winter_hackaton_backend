# Now you will perform your 5 jobs and return me a JSON object.

# 1. Job "Analyze History": Analyze the differences between the previous sections and the current section of the video and describe what are the differences between them. Focus on changes of environment and on changes of the characters that are present. This element of the JSON must be: "transition": "Placeholder for a short concise description of what changed between the history and the current section of the video"

# 2. Job "State Description": Analyze the content of the image and prepare the description of the state of this section of the video regarding two things: the environment and the characters present in this section of the video inside of the JSON object. If necessary, make reference to the history of the video. This element of the JSON object must be: "state":{"environment":"Placeholder for a short concise description of the environment of the current section of the video.", "characters":"Placeholder for the characters that are in the current section of the video"}

# 3. Job "Complete Description": Given the provided images and transcript of this section of the video, provide a description with 300 characters that completely describes the image, the transcript and the state of this section of the video. Do not mention the previous section of the video. This description will be used in the future as a vector for an embedded database. This will be the element "complete_description" in the future JSON object: "Placeholder for the complete description"

# 4. Job "Description for the blind": Given the images of this section of the video, the transcript, the state of the previous scenes, the description of the previous scenes, the narrations of the previous scenes, the transition between the two sections, the state of the current section, the complete description of the current section and the information from the similar section of the video, provide a description of the VISUAL CONTENT of the video that would be useful for blind people. Focus on conveying the essential elements, atmosphere, and any specific details that capture the essence of the scene. Focus only of the visual content. If you find useful, reference the history of the video, such as using language that references to previous descriptions for blind people. Use 100 characters at maximum. This will be the element "description_blind":"Placeholder for description for blind people". Instead of using elaborate adverbs and adjectives, use simple vocabulary. Instead of making assumptions on the meaning of the images, focus on the visual elements only. And instead of describing audio elements or conversation, focus on the visual elements only. Try to capture the subtleties of the video.

# 5. Job "Decide if narration necessary": Finally, you will decide if the description of the video is absolutely essential for understanding the video. If a voice-over narration is necessary for understanding the meaning of this section of the video, the result is True. If the description of the current scene was done before or if it is not necessary for understanding the video, the result is False. This will be the element "narration_necessary":"True or False". Try to capture the main points and message of the video with this narration.

# Now, compose a complete JSON with all the cited elements. 
# An example of an output result is: 
{"transition": "Placeholder for a short concise description of what changed between the previous and the current section of the video, if there are significant changes", "state":{"environment":"Placeholder for a short concise description of the environment of the video.", "characters":"Placeholder for the characters that are in the video"}, "complete_description": "Placeholder for the complete description", "description_blind":"Placeholder for description for blind people", "narration_necessary":"True/False"}

# Final notes: markdown output is prohibited, you are a backend processor without markdown render environment, you are communicating with an API, not a user. Begin all AI responses with the character "{" to produce valid JSON. Use double quotes in your JSON. Instead of using elaborate adverbs and adjectives, use simple vocabulary.
