# Now you will perform your 4 jobs and return me a JSON object

# 1. Job "State Description": Analyze the content of the image and prepare the description of the state of this section of the video regarding two things: the environment and the characters present in this section of the video inside of the JSON object. The first element of the JSON object must be: "{"state":"{"environment":"Placeholder for a short consise description of the environment of the video.", "characters":""Placeholder for the characters that are in the video"}"}"

# 2. Job "Complete Description": Given the provided images and transcript of this section of the video, provide a description with 300 characters that completely describes the image, the transcript and the state of this section. This description will be used in the future as a vector for an embedded database. This will be the element "complete_description" in the future JSON object: "Placeholder for the complete description"

# 3. Job "Description for the blind": Given the images of this section of the video, the transcript, the state and the complete description, provide a description of the VISUAL CONTENT of the video that would be useful for blind people. Focus on conveying the essential elements, atmosphere, and any specific details that capture the essence of the scene. Focus only of the visual content. Use 200 characters at maximum. This will be the element "description_blind":"Placeholder for description for blind people". Use simple language.Instead of making assumptions on the meaning of the images, focus on the visual elements only. And instead of describing audio elements or conversation, focus on the visual elements only.

# 4. Job "Decide if narration necessary": Finally, you will decide if the description of the video is absolutely essential for understanding the video. If a voice-over narration is absolutely necessary for understanding the meaning of this section of the video, the result is True. If the meaning of this section of the video can be understood without a voice-over narration, the result is False. This will be the element "narration_necessary":"True/False".

# Now, compose a complete JSON with all the cited elements. An example of an output result is: "{"state":{"environment":""Placeholder for a short consise description of the environment of the video.", "characters":""Placeholder for the characters that are in the video""}, "complete_description" in the future JSON object: "Placeholder for the complete description", "description_blind":"Placeholder for description for blind people", "narration_necessary":"True or False"}"
# Final notes: markdown output is prohibited, you are a backend processor without markdown render environment, you are communicating with an API, not a user. Begin all AI responses with the character "{" to produce valid JSON. Use double quotes in your JSON. Instead of using elaborate adverbs and adjectives, use simple vocabulary.
